# Blockchain From Scratch

This project demonstrates how to build a simple blockchain and cryptocurrency system using **Python** and **Flask**, simulating key elements like mining, transactions, and peer-to-peer (P2P) networking.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧱 Block structure with SHA256 hashing
- ⛏️ Proof-of-work mining algorithm
- 💸 Transaction pool
- 🌐 RESTful API to interact with the blockchain
- 🔁 Consensus algorithm to resolve conflicts between nodes
- 🤝 Node registration for decentralized network simulation
- 🪙 Mining rewards (default 100 coins)
- 🧪 Swagger documentation for each node

## 📦 How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install flask flasgger requests
